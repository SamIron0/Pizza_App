## Overview:
This Android app allows users to order pizza from a selection of items and uses an MVC architecture. The app has been tested on emulator on Windows, Nexus 7 running Android 6.0, with API 23 and has passed unit, integration and acceptance tests to ensure its functionality.

## Architecture:
The app is designed using an MVC structure with Model, View, and Controller components. The Model layer manages and accesses data, utilizing a DataAccessObject class for data stored in HSQLDB. The View layer is made up of Android Activities and Fragments, while the Controller layer contains classes that manage user input and application logic, including calculating order totals and displaying order summaries. As shown below.
